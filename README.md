# Talks and Presentations

This repository holds all my example repositories used in talks and presentations as submodules.

## Warnings

- Some of these repositories may refer to content to which I have no access to the video content, but the examples are here anyway.
- The repositories listed here are way more useful to complement the presentation they were used in.
